Since there is no one-stop-shop with information and instructions on how to pull off a successful event, eVentry is here to provide you exactly that. eVentry (where creativity shines) is a web application to share and manage an inventory of event ideas, where members can share their events and talk about how, why and where they got various elements. It uses a PostgresQL database to store user added data and is built with a Python/Flask backend.
